// crates/core/src/builtins/mod.rs
//! Native builtins: bare-call globals (`println(x)`) and instance methods
//! (`myList.push(x)`), plus builtin *static namespaces* (`Math.sqrt(x)`).
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Before this split, sema and the interpreter each had their own idea of
//! what builtins existed — sema didn't know about them at all (`println`
//! resolved as `UndefinedName`), and the interpreter's list lived in one
//! flat file with `len`/`push`/`pop`/`contains` implemented a *second*
//! time, differently, as inline match arms for instance-method calls.
//!
//! `GLOBAL_BUILTINS` (see `global.rs`) is now the single source of truth
//! for bare-call builtins, consumed by sema, the interpreter, and — once
//! it exists — LLVM codegen. `instance.rs` plays the same role for
//! receiver methods, modulo the dispatch-shape difference noted there.
